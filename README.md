# SIMPL-Daikin-WiFi
Crestron SIMPL module for Daikin WiFi dongle

Very preliminary but working module for Daikin WiFi dongle.
Example GUI included.
Processor used: MC3

Module was written during free nights after work for my house.
I think module is ready also for a customer installation. I found it very stable and useful.

If u use it for commercial use, feel free to offer me a pizza! :)
